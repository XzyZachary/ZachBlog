To summarize: Nuxt 2 remained stable with 0% errors at around 400 concurrent requests, while Nuxt 3 remained stable with 0% errors at around 650 concurrent requests.


In conclusion, the performance gap between Nuxt 2 and Nuxt 3 seems significant, and we are uncertain if the data is accurate. 

There are some online speculations that suggest the limitations of Vue's API might have caused the relative performance gap of Nuxt.
